Installation
------------
CADET can be installed via conda from the ``conda-forge`` channel.

``conda install -c conda-forge cadet``

This requires a working `conda installation <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html>`_.

Optionally, use `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ which uses a faster dependency solver than ``conda``.

``mamba install -c conda-forge cadet``

`Additional information <https://cadet.github.io/master/getting_started/installation>`_ and a `tutorial <https://cadet.github.io/master/getting_started/tutorials/breakthrough>`_ are available to guide you through the installation and the first steps of using CADET.


Ongoing Development
-------------------

We do our best to provide you with a stable API. However, CADET is actively developed and breaking changes can sometimes be unavoidable. For non-developers, it is recommended to upgrade from release to release instead of always working with the most recent commit.

Bugs
----

Please report any bugs that you find `here <https://github.com/modsim/cadet/issues>`_. Or, even better, fork the repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/modsim/cadet>`_ and create a pull request (PR) with the fix. 

Donations
---------

`Donations <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=FCQ2M89558ZAG>`_ for helping to host, maintain, and further develop the CADET project are highly appreciated.

Installation
------------
CADET-Core can be installed via conda from the ``conda-forge`` channel.

``conda install -c conda-forge cadet``

This requires a working `conda installation <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_.

`Additional information <https://cadet.github.io/master/getting_started/installation>`_ and a `tutorial <https://cadet.github.io/master/getting_started/tutorials/breakthrough>`_ are available to guide you through the installation and the first steps of using CADET.

Citing
------------
The development of CADET-Core has been a collaborative effort, with multiple dedicated individuals contributing their expertise to create a powerful and versatile open-source software tool.
Countless hours of hard work have been invested to provide the scientific community with a valuable resource.
As an open-source project, CADET-Core relies on the support and recognition from users and researchers to thrive.
Therefore, we kindly ask that any publications or projects leveraging the capabilities of CADET-Core acknowledge its creators and their contributions by citing an adequate selection of our publications.

Ongoing Development
-------------------

We do our best to provide you with a stable API. However, CADET-Core is actively developed and breaking changes can sometimes be unavoidable. For non-developers, it is recommended to upgrade from release to release instead of always working with the most recent commit.

Bugs
----

Please report any bugs that you find `here <https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core/issues>`_. Or, even better, fork the repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core>`_ and create a pull request (PR) with the fix. 

Donations
---------

`Donations <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=FCQ2M89558ZAG>`_ for helping to host, maintain, and further develop the CADET-Core project are highly appreciated.

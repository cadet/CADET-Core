# Build CADET-Core on Windows

## Prerequisites

* Microsoft Visual Studio **2022** (Community Edition, or better)
* Intel OneAPI MKL
* Optional: Git
* Optional but not generally recommended*: Intel OneAPI TBB

*For most use-cases it is more efficient to parallelize by running multiple CADET-Core simulations instead
of parallelizing within one CADET-Core simulation. Including the parallelization code in CADET-Core can lead to performance
losses, even if parallelization within CADET-Core is not used.
Therefore, we recommend not including the parallelization library TBB
unless you know your simulations are large enough to benefit from it.

Assumed directory structure:

<pre>
|- CADET-Core
|    - src
|    - include
|    - [...]
</pre>

Note that the version numbers of the files and packages below are subject to change and will not always reflect the most
recent version.


## Visual Studio:
We are using Visual Studio because it is the easiest way to install all required tools, compilers etc. in one step.

- Download [MS Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/)
- Install Visual Studio with the workload "Desktop Developments with C++"

## Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit

- Download
  the [Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit online installer](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=window&distributions=webdownload&options=online).
- During the installation, select "Custom Installation" and deselect everything except for:
    - Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (MKL)
    - optional*: Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (TBB)

## Optional:  clink

- Clink provides text completion, history, and line-editing to Windows Command Prompt
- Download the [clink installer exe](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink) and install clink.

## Obtain CADET-Core code

- Clone the CADET-Core source code into a `CADET-Core` folder:
  - `git clone https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core.git CADET-Core`

## Build CADET-Core in Visual Studio

- Open Visual Studio and open the `CADET-Core` folder
- Navigate to "Tools" - "Command Line" and open either a "Developer Command Prompt" or "Developer PowerShell"
- Execute the following command:
    - `vcpkg integrate install` (this only needs to be run _once_ per PC and will require admin privileges)
- At the top, where it says `DEBUG`, select `aRELEASE` instead
- Wait for `vcpkg` to install all the dependencies. The first time this is done on your PC it can take ~15-30 minutes
- Wait for `cmake generation` to finish (see `output` window)
- From the status bar at the top select `Build`, `Build all`
- Once that finishes, select `Build`, `Install CadetFramework`
- The binaries will be located in `CADET-Core\out\install\aRELEASE\bin`


## Build CADET-Core from the command line

- Open Visual Studio and select "continue without code"
- Navigate to "Tools" - "Command Line" and open either a "Developer Command Prompt" or "Developer PowerShell"
- Execute the following commands:
- For Command Prompt:
    - `if not exist CADET-Core\build mkdir CADET-Core\build`
    - `cd CADET-Core\build`
    - `vcpkg integrate install` (this only needs to be run _once_ and will require admin privileges)
    - `set MKLROOT="C:/Program Files (x86)/Intel/oneAPI/mkl/latest"`
    - `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\out\install\aRELEASE -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_LAPACK=ON -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_DEPS=ON -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq --fresh ../`
        - If you want to use parallelization and have installed TBB, instead
          execute `set TBBROOT="C:/Program Files (x86)/Intel/oneAPI/tbb/latest"` and
        - `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=..\out\install\aRELEASE -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_LAPACK=ON -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_DEPS=ON -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp --fresh ../`
    - `msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64`

- For PowerShell:
    - `if (-Not(Test-Path CADET-Core\build)){mkdir CADET-Core\build}`
    - `cd CADET-Core\build`
    - `vcpkg integrate install` (this only needs to be run _once_ and will require admin privileges)
    - `$ENV:MKLROOT = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\mkl\latest"`
    - `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="..\out\install\aRELEASE" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ENV:VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_LAPACK=ON -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_DEPS=ON -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp_seq "../" --fresh`
      - If you want to use parallelization and have installed TBB, instead
           execute `$ENV:TBBROOT = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\tbb\latest"`
      and
      - `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="..\out\install\aRELEASE" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ENV:VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_LAPACK=ON -DENABLE_STATIC_LINK_DEPS=ON -DBLA_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp "../" --fresh`
    - `msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration="Release;Platform=x64"`
- There are further compile flags that can be passed to the above cmake command, please refer to the build options described in the developer guide.
- The binaries will be located in `CADET-Core\out\install\aRELEASE\bin`

## Test build results
- Navigate to the install location `cd CADET-Core\out\install\aRELEASE\bin`
- Run:
  - `cadet-cli.exe --version`
  - `createLWE.exe`
  - `cadet-cli.exe LWE.h5`
- And confirm the output of the LWE.h5 by opening it in HDF5view or loading it in CADET-Process.
- If you get no printed return from the first command, run cadet-cli.exe by double-clicking it in the file explorer.
This raises error messages that are not raised from a cmd or PowerShell window.

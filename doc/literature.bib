abstract = {Although the physicochemical and beneficial properties of nanoparticles have drawn widespread attention in recent years, their potential for causing environmental damage and ecological toxicity (ecotoxicity) is not fully understood. This chapter provides contemporary information regarding characteristics of the environment (atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere), distribution of bulk and nanoparticles in different spheres, fate of nanoparticles (in air, water, and soil), and adverse effects of different groups of nanoparticles on various types of ecosystems. Although many nanoparticles have been shown to cause potent ecological damage, the results from studies often differ, possibly due to heterogeneity in the physical properties of nanoparticles and the environment, the species and habitat differences, nanoparticles' unique electronic and chemical properties, differences in biomarkers used, and presence of toxins and other contaminants associated with the nanoparticle that may modulate its toxicity. Elucidating these issues may represent a critical future research direction to establish the safe use of nanoparticles.}

abstract = {The presence of a liquid stationary phase in liquid–liquid chromatography (LLC) allows for high versatility of operation as well as adaptability to different sample types and separation tasks. LLC, also known as countercurrent chromatography (CCC) or centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), offers the user a variety of operating modes, many of which have no direct equivalent in conventional preparative liquid–solid chromatography. These operating modes have the potential to greatly improve LLC separation performance compared to the standard “classical” isocratic batch injection mode, and they often require minimal to no addition of equipment to the standard set-up. However, reports of the use of alternative LLC operating modes make up only a fraction of the literature. This is likely due, at least in part, to the lack of clear guidelines and methods for operating mode and parameter selection, leaving alternative process options to be avoided and underutilized. This review seeks to remedy this by providing a thorough overview of the available LLC operating modes, identifying the key characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and areas of application of each. Additionally, the equations and short-cut models aiding in operating mode and parameter selection are presented and critiqued, and their notation is unified for clarity. By rendering LLC and its alternative operating modes more accessible to current and prospective users, it is hoped to help expand the application of this technology and support the achievement of its full potential.}

Introduction
============

Global structure
----------------

The global structure (see :numref:`FFRootFig`) is divided into three parts: ``input``, ``output``, and ``meta``.
Every valid CADET file needs an ``input`` group (see :numref:`FFInputFig`) which contains all relevant information for simulating a model.
It does not need an ``output`` (see :numref:`FFOutputFig`) or ``meta`` (see :numref:`FFRootFig`) group, since those are created when results are written.
Whereas the ``output`` group is solely used as output and holds the results of the simulation, the ``meta`` group is used for input and output.
Details such as file format version and simulator version are read from and written to the ``meta`` group.

If not explicitly stated otherwise, all datasets are mandatory.
By convention all group names are lowercase, whereas all dataset names are uppercase.
Note that this is just a description of the file format and not a detailed explanation of the meaning of the parameters.
For the latter, please refer to the corresponding sections in the previous chapter.

Notation and identifiers
------------------------

Reference volumes are denoted by subscripts:

- :math:`m_{IV}^{3}` Interstitial volume
- :math:`m_{MP}^{3}` Bead mobile phase volume
- :math:`m_{SP}^{3}` Bead solid phase volume

Common notation and identifiers that are used in the subsequent description are listed in
:numref:`table_notation_identifiers`.

     - Value of a generic unspecified parameter


Ordering of multi dimensional data
----------------------------------

Some model parameters, especially in certain binding models, require multi dimensional data.
Since CADET only reads one dimensional arrays, the layout of the data has to be specified (i.e., the way how the data is linearized in memory).
The term “*xyz*-major” means that the index corresponding to *xyz* changes the slowest.

For instance, suppose a model with :math:`2` components and :math:`3` bound states has a “component-major” dataset.
Then, the requested matrix is stored in memory such that all bound states are listed for each component (i.e., the component index changes the slowest and the bound state index the fastest):

::

     comp0bnd0, comp0bnd1, comp0bnd2, comp1bnd0, comp1bnd1, comp1bnd2.

This linear array can be represented as a :math:`2 \times 3` matrix in “row-major” storage format, or a :math:`3 \times 2` matrix in “column-major” ordering.


.. _section_dependent_parameters:

Section dependent model parameters
----------------------------------

Some model parameters (see :numref:`section_dependent_datasets`) can be assigned different values for each section.
For example, the velocity a column is operated with could differ in the load, wash, and elution phases.
Section dependency is recognized by specifying the appropriate number of values for the parameters (see *Length* column in the following tables).
If a parameter depends on both the component and the section, the ordering is section-major.

For instance, the *Length* field of the parameter ``VELOCITY`` reads :math:`1 / NSEC` which means that it is not recognized as section dependent if only :math:`1` value (scalar) is passed. However, if ``NSEC`` many values (vector) are present, it will be treated as section dependent.

Note that all components of component dependent datasets have to be section dependent (e.g., you cannot have a section dependency on component :math:`2` only while the other components are not section dependent).

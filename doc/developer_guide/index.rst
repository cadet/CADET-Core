Developer Guide
===============

This developer guide is intended to help expand and maintain CADET-Core and is written to serve developers with diverse backgrounds.

If you find any gaps or have suggestions for improvement, your input is valuable in refining our documentation for better comprehension by all developers.
Please feel free to open an `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core/issues>`_ or, even better, write a draft and create a pull request.

When planning to extend or contribute to CADET-Core, please adhere to our notation style and research software engineering (RSE) best practices.
For detailed guidance, you can e.g. refer to the `RSE guidelines <https://rse-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>`_.
Since some developers may be new to collaborative software development using Git and GitHub, we specifically recommend consulting the `Git RSE guide <https://rse-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>`_.

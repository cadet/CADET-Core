CADET-Core
==========

CADET is developed at the Institute of Bio- and Geosciences 1 (IBG-1) of Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ) under supervision of Prof. Eric von Lieres.
The heart of the CADET software is CADET-Core, a fast and accurate solver for a comprehensive model family.
Typical applications include (but are by far not limited to) chromatography, filtration, crystallization, and fermentation.
CADET-Core can handle arbitrary sequences and networks of unit operations, including reactors, tanks, tubes, pumps, valves, detectors, etc.
The resulting models are solved with state-of-the-art mathematical algorithms and scientific computing techniques.

Features
--------

* Fast and accurate solution of strongly coupled partial differential algebraic equations (PDAE)
* Computation of parameter sensitivities with algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* Shared memory parallelization using Intel TBB
* Python interface
* Support of HDF5 and XML data formats
* Flexible and extensible through modular design
* Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X

CADET Platform
--------------

CADET-Core is part of `CADET <https://github.com/cadet>`_, a collective platform of software repositories that provide tools for biotechnology process modeling.
CADET-Core can be used as a standalone simulator by interfacing via HDF5 files. Alternatively, CADET-Python provides a wrapper around an HDF5 file reader and writer, simplifying model configuration. 
Furthermore, it is the interface for CADET-Process, an universal and user-friendly tool for biotechnology process modeling and evaluation.

For more information on the different packages of the CADET platform, see :ref:`here <getting_started>`.

Installation
------------

CADET-Core can be installed via conda from the ``conda-forge`` channel.

``conda install -c conda-forge cadet``

This requires a working `conda installation <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html>`_.

Optionally, use `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ which uses a faster dependency solver than ``conda``.

``mamba install -c conda-forge cadet``

For more information on how to install and build CADET, see :ref:`here <getting_started>`.

Ongoing Development
-------------------

We do our best to provide you with a stable API.
However, CADET-Core is actively developed and breaking changes can sometimes be unavoidable.
For non-developers, it is recommended to upgrade from release to release instead of always working with the most recent commit.


Bugs
----

Please report any bugs that you find `here <https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core/issues>`_. Or, even better, fork the repository on `GitHub <https://github.com/cadet/cadet-core>`_ and create a pull request (PR) with the fix. 

Donations
---------

`Donations <https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=FCQ2M89558ZAG>`_ for helping to host, maintain, and further develop the CADET-Core project are highly appreciated.


Citing
------

The development of CADET-Core has been a collaborative effort, with multiple dedicated individuals contributing their expertise to create a powerful and versatile open-source software tool.
Countless hours of hard work have been invested to provide the scientific community with a valuable resource.
As an open-source project, CADET-Core relies on the support and recognition from users and researchers to thrive.
Therefore, we kindly ask that any publications or projects leveraging the capabilities of CADET-Core acknowledge its creators and their contributions by citing an adequate selection of our publications.

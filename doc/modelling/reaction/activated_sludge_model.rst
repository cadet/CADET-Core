Activated Sludge Model (ASM3h)
-------------------------

Activated Sludge Models are a group of reaction models published by the International Water Association (IWA)
and mostly used for modelling biological processes in wastewater treatment plants.

The ASM3h model implemented in CADET is a variant of the ASM3 model and documented in the SIMBA# software suite.

For more information on model parameters required to define in CADET file format, see :ref:`activated_sludge_model_config`.

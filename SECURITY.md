# Security Policy

## 1. No Network Dependencies

CADET operates entirely offline and does not require any network access, nor does it handle sensitive information such as personal identifiers. This eliminates common attack vectors like network exploits or data breaches.

## 2. Code Integrity and Contribution Reviews

While there are no significant security risks associated with using CADET, we maintain strict controls over our source code. Any external contributions to the project are thoroughly reviewed and must meet our contribution guidelines. All pull requests are checked to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.

## 3. Dependency Management

CADET does not rely on third-party libraries that introduce network or verification components. We carefully manage dependencies to ensure they are up-to-date and secure.

## 4. Reporting Vulnerabilities

Though CADET does not involve typical security risks, we encourage users and contributors to report any unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities they may discover. Please contact us via cadet@fz-juelich.de if you believe you've found a security issue.

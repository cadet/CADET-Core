	/**
	 * @brief Solves nonlinear equations using a residual oriented descent based global adaptive trust-region Newton method
	 * @details This is an implementation of the NLEQ-RES algorithm described in \cite Deuflhard2011 (p. 131).
	 *          It is a global adaptive trust-region Newton method based on affine contravariance.
	 *          In the framework of affine invariance, the solution of the inner trust region problems is
	 *          a point on the ordinary Newton step line segment. Thus, in the end this algorithm is an adaptively
	 *          damped Newton method with global convergence.
	 *          
	 *          This algorithm is designed to solve the nonlinear equation system
	 *          @f[\begin{align} f(x) = 0, \qquad f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n. \end{align}@f]
	 *          A solution is indicated by the error test
	 *          @f[\begin{align} \left\lVert f(x) \right\rVert_{\ell^2} \leq \text{tol} \end{align}@f]
	 *          with a given tolerance (@p resTol).
	 *          
	 *          The residuals @f$ f(x) @f$ are evaluated using the given function @p residual.
	 *          The resulting linear equation systems 
	 *          @f[\begin{align} J_f(x) \Delta x = r, \end{align}@f]
	 *          where @f$ J_f(x) @f$ denotes the Jacobian of @f$ f @f$ at point @f$ x @f$ and @f$ r = f(x) @f$
	 *          is a given right hand side, are solved using the given function @p jacobianSolver.
	 *          
	 *          The initial damping factor @p damping and the minimal damping factor @p minDamping
	 *          can be chosen based on reference values for different problem difficulties:
	 *          | Difficulty          | damping | minDamping |
	 *          | ------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
	 *          | Mildly nonlinear    | 1.0     | 1e-4       |
	 *          | Highly nonlinear    | 1e-2    | 1e-4       |
	 *          | Extremely nonlinear | 1e-4    | 1e-8       |
	 *          In the case of extremely nonlinear problems, a restricted error test is recommended (not available
	 *          through public interface).
	 *          
	 *          Note that, since this method is based on residual monotonicity, this method can fail
	 *          in practice even if the conditions guaranteeing global convergence are satisfied.
	 *          This is, for example, the case for ill-conditioned Jacobians, since then @f$ x_{k+1} \approx x_k @f$
	 *          and the iteration is stalled. See pp. 137 in the Deuflhard book.
	 *          A more robust, but also more costly, algorithm is implemented in robustAdaptiveTrustRegionNewtonMethod().
	 * @param [in] residual Function providing the residual @f$ f(x) @f$ at position @f$ x @f$ of the nonlinear equation 
	 *             system @f$ f(x) = 0 @f$ to be solved.
	 *             The signature of the function is
	 *             `bool residual(double const* const x, double* const r)`
	 *             where the return value communicates whether the evaluation has been successful.
	 *             On exit, the residual is returned in-place in @f$ r @f$.
	 *             If an error is indicated by returning @c false, the algorithm aborts with failure.
	 * @param [in] jacobianSolver Function calculating the solution of the linear system @f$ J_f(x) \Delta x = r@f$ 
	 *             with Jacobian matrix @f$ J_f(x) @f$ at position @f$ x @f$ for a given right hand side @f$ r @f$. 
	 *             The signature of the function is
	 *             `bool jacobianSolver(double const* const x, double* const r)`
	 *             where the return value communicates whether the system has been solved correctly.
	 *             On exit, the solution of the linear system is returned in-place in @f$ r @f$ which on entry
	 *             contains the right hand side vector of the linear system.
	 *             If an error is indicated by returning @c false, the algorithm aborts with failure.
	 * @param [in] maxIter Maximum number of iterations
	 * @param [in] resTol Termination criterion on the residual @f$\ell^2@f$-norm
	 * @param [in] damping Initial damping factor (see details for advice)
	 * @param [in] minDamping Minimal damping factor (see details for advice)
	 * @param [in,out] point On entry initial guess, on exit solution or last iterate
	 * @param [in] workingMemory Additional memory of size @f$ 4n @f$ required for performing the iterations, where @f$ n @f$ is the problem @p size
	 * @param [in] size Size of the problem (i.e., number of equations, length of residual, columns of Jacobian etc.)
	 * @tparam IterateOutputPolicy Policy that handles output of intermediate values (useful for debugging), see VoidNewtonIterateOutputPolicy
	 * @return @c true if a solution meeting the residual tolerance was found, @c false otherwise
	 * @todo Make algorithm more robust by providing means to solver and residual functions to trigger decrease of damping factor (e.g. for negative concentrations)
	 * @todo Implement scaling of linear systems and norms

function data = switchStorageOrdering(data, dims)
%SWITCHSTORAGEORDERING Changes the storage order of an array from column-major (Matlab) to row-major (CADET) and vice versa
%   DATA = SWITCHSTORAGEORDERING(DATA) infers the dimensions of the given array DATA and
%   shuffles them around in order to switch between column-major (Matlab) and row-major (CADET).
%
%   DATA = SWITCHSTORAGEORDERING(DATA, DIMS) takes the given array DATA and dimensions DIMS (vector
%   as returned by calling size(DATA)) and shuffles them around in order to switch between 
%   column-major (Matlab) and row-major (CADET).

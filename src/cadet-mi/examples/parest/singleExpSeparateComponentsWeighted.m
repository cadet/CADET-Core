function singleExpSeparateComponentsWeighted()
%SINGLEEXPSEPARATECOMPONENTSWEIGHTED Fits adsorption rates in a single experiment in which each component is observed separately and weighted
%
%   The goal is to fit the adsorption rates KA (which ultimately correspond to the equilibrium
%   constants due to quasi-stationary binding mode) in the load-wash-elution example using
%   artificial data. One experiment is performed and each component is observed separately
%   (i.e., fractionation data is used).
%
%   The loading of the three components is not the same and, thus, the peaks do not have
%   the same mass. This can cause problems for the optimizer as it may decide to work on
%   large peaks that reduce the residual more than a better fit of small peaks. This
%   problem can be overcome by weighting the different components according to their
%   masses, such that the mass seen by the optimizer is the same for all components.
%   Additionally, the signal from the loading phase is weighted less than the rest.
%
%   Note that all the weights in ParameterFit are multiplicative.

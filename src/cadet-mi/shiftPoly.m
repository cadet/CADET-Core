function newPoly = shiftPoly(poly, shift)
%SHIFTPOLY Shifts a polynomial to a different expansion point
%   NEWPOLY = SHIFTPOLY(POLY, SHIFT) shifts a polynomial 
%   p(x) = a_n * x^n + ... a_1 * x + a_0 to q(x) = p(x - y), where y is
%   given by SHIFT. The polynomial coefficients POLY follow the Matlab
%   convention (i.e., the highest exponent comes first). The resulting
%   polynomial q is returned as coefficients using the same convention.

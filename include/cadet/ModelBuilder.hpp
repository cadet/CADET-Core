/**
 * @brief Provides functionality to build a model
 * @details Builds a system of unit operation models or creates single unit operation models
 *          from given parameters.
 *          
 *          The IModelBuilder owns all IModelSystem it created. The ownership of a specific system
 *          can be released by calling detachSystem(). Detached IModelSystem objects can be destroyed
 *          by calling destroySystem().
 *          
 *          Note that the IModelBuilder does not own the created IModel objects. Unit operation
 *          models are supposed to be assigned to an IModelSystem which owns them. However, wrongfully
 *          created IModel objects can be destroyed by calling destroyUnitOperation().
 *          
 *          Once registered, external functions are also owned by the IModelBuilder and can be released
 *          via detachExternalFunction(). Otherwise they will be deleted when the IModelBuilder is
 *          deleted. The external functions are indexed by the IModelBuilder, which serves as their ID.

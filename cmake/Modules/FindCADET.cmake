# Find CADET.
#
# On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable CADET_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
# to determine whether or not to prefer a static link over a dynamic link for CADET
# and all of it's dependencies. To use this feature, make sure that the
# CADET_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.
#
# To provide the module with a hint about where to find your CADET installation,
# you can set the environment variable CADET_ROOT. The FindCADET module will then
# look in this path when searching for CADET paths and libraries.
#
# This module will define the following variables:
#  CADET_INCLUDE_DIRS - Location of the CADET includes
#  CADET_FOUND - true if CADET was found on the system
#  CADET_LIBRARIES - Required libraries for all requested components

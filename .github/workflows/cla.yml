              Thank you for your submission, we really appreciate it!

              Like many open-source projects we ask that you sign our [Contributor License Agreement](${{ env.PATH_TO_CLA }}) before we can accept your contribution.
              To sign, please post two separate comments based on the following templates ðŸ‘‡

              1. Comment:

              ----
              ```markdown
              - [ ] The CADET maintainers know my real name.

              At least one of the following two applies:

              - [ ] The CADET maintainers know my current employer.

              - [ ] I am *not* making this contribution on behalf of my current employer.
              ```

              ----

              2. Comment:
          custom-pr-sign-comment: I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA.
          #custom-allsigned-prcomment: 'pull request comment when all contributors has signed, defaults to **CLA Assistant Lite bot** All Contributors have signed the CLA.'
          # ðŸ‘‡ prevent contributors from revoking signatures after the merge (this is also the default)
          lock-pullrequest-aftermerge: true
          #use-dco-flag: true - If you are using DCO instead of CLA
